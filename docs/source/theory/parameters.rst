Parameter Index 
===============

Here is a list of some of the parameters used within this simulation: 

- :math:`N_{cfg}`: This is the number of configurations sampled within the simulation 
- :math:`G(t)`: This is the correlation function at a particular time separation :math:`t`.
- :math:`dE`: The energy difference :math:`\Delta E = E_1 - E_0` between the ground and first excited state of the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator. 
- :math:`x(t)`: The "path" of a particle indicating its position at some time :math:`t`.


# Input Parameters 

Here is a list of some of the input parameters to be set in the simulation: 

- :math:`a`: The thickness of the grid spacing between time points, :math:`a = t_{i+1} - t_i`.

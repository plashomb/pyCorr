pyCorr documentation
====================

`pyCorr` is a Python implementation of the Monte Carlo Metropolis Algorithm for estimating correlation functions and 
energy differences for the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator. 

This simulation is heavily inspired by the work by the following works:

- `Lattice QCD for Novices <https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-lat/0506036>`_
  
- `Monte Carlo Applications and Lattice QCD <https://digitalcommons.lib.uconn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1502&context=srhonors_theses>`_
